  "aml_section_documents_title": "When we request documents",
  "aml_section_documents_text": "The need for documents depends on your total purchase volume and the risk level of your country. For low volumes, users from low-risk countries can usually participate with only a completed profile. From certain thresholds or if you are from a higher-risk country, we will ask for an identity document and, if needed, a proof of address before activating full rights on your NFT.",

  "aml_section_countries_text": "Internally we classify countries into three risk zones: green (lower risk), grey (higher risk, allowed only with full KYC and limits) and red (service not available). For example, EU/EEA countries and other developed jurisdictions are typically in the green zone; some countries, such as Russia or the United States, are treated as grey; and a small number of jurisdictions under strict sanctions are in the red zone and cannot use the service.",

  "aml_section_storage_text": "Profile data and uploaded documents are stored in protected systems with strict access control. Only the project owner and, in the future, a very limited group of authorised staff can view KYC documents, and every status change is logged. We keep data for the minimum period required for AML and legal obligations, after which it is deleted or anonymised.",

  "nft.explain.tree.d0": "Until the official reveal, the card is shown as a single “mystery box” placeholder. The NFT already belongs to you, is visible in your dashboard, and is stored in your wallet.\n\nAt the reveal event, the final image of the selected archetype (Tree/Steel), the serial number, and part of the metadata are disclosed.\n\nPlanned reveal window — Q2 2026. We will announce the exact date in advance — in the dashboard and in the project’s Telegram channel.\n\nAfter the reveal, the metadata are fixed (immutable): the image and properties do not change. Trading on marketplaces is possible both before and after the reveal; the price is formed by the market and is not a promise of profit.",
  "nft.explain.tree.d1": "A total of 2,000 Tree/Steel NFTs are issued — one shared supply across both designs. This is a fixed quantity with no additional prints. Each card has a unique serial number and remains part of the collection forever.\n\nAt purchase you choose the archetype — “Tree” or “Steel”. All cards share the same series, equal terms, and a common numbering. No new issues are planned for this series.\n\nThe limited supply underscores the value of participation: Tree/Steel holders are the first wave of support and form the foundation of the VIGRI collection.",
  "nft.explain.tree.d2": "Every Tree/Steel NFT holder receives VIGRI at the token launch (TGE). Allocation is automatic — no buttons or requests — and goes to the same wallet that holds the NFT.\n\nThe number of tokens is fixed at the starting price and does not depend on later NFT price changes. Even if the NFT presale price increases, the allocation remains the same as for early participants — ensuring fairness and equal rules for all.\n\nThis mechanism creates a fair launch: those who supported earlier receive tokens at the best price. Allocated VIGRI become available right after TGE and fully belong to the NFT owner.\n\nIf the NFT is sold before TGE, the allocation right passes to the new owner. Distribution uses a network snapshot at a pre-announced time. To ensure receipt, keep the NFT in your own wallet during the snapshot (not in a marketplace escrow).",
  "nft.explain.tree.d3": "At purchase you choose one of two archetypes — “Tree” or “Steel”. These are visual styles of the same series: rights and terms are identical.\n\nThe choice is made at checkout (in the buy card). After the transaction is confirmed, the design is bound to the NFT and cannot be changed; you can switch only before the final confirmation.\n\nA physical card is not provided in this series.\n\nYou are not just buying a card — you are choosing who you feel you are within Lumiros:\n🌱 Tree — growth, nature, soul, creation.\n⚙️ Steel — structure, intellect, order, responsibility.\n\nThis is more than an NFT — it is a first act of self-identification in the project’s philosophy.\nTree or Steel — choose what resonates with you.\nThe first Lumiros card is not just an NFT, but a choice of beginning: living growth or steely will.\nTwo paths — one purpose.",
  "nft.explain.tree.d4": "Every card has its own serial number — part of the collection’s metadata and a unique identifier within the series. The number appears at the reveal event and is then fixed forever.\n\nThe number is stored on-chain together with the NFT: you can see it in your dashboard and on marketplaces. Duplicates are impossible — each card has its own mint address and its own number.\n\nThe serial number does not change the card’s terms or rights; it serves transparency, authenticity verification, and supports collectible value.",
  "nft.explain.tree.d5": "“Cards of Essence” is a philosophical and artistic project of the Lumiros ecosystem, where each card becomes part of a wider universe of ideas and cultural symbols. They connect art, thought, and real-world value — both as digital and as physical artifacts.\n\nEach card has its number, story, and visual image created by an invited studio or artist. Series are released in limited runs under the Lumiros Publishing imprint — once per year a new series is created via an open competition of design studios so each era has its own signature.\n\nThe project carries a genuine collector spirit: each card is part of a living gallery of ideas, where value is shaped by time, meaning, and people’s participation.\n\nTree/Steel holders receive the status of participants in the Lumiros card project and may receive invitations to new releases and special opportunities within the ecosystem.\n\nYou are not simply buying an image — you receive a fragment of a larger story about the human being, memory, and purpose.",

By purchasing Bronze, you secure your card and the right to receive 187,500 VIGRI.\n\nThe card belongs to you: you can hold it, gift it, or sell it on marketplaces. It will appear in your personal dashboard under 'My NFTs', and all related rights will be available there as well.

The exact date will be announced in advance — in your dashboard and on the project's Telegram channel.\n\nAfter the reveal, the metadata becomes fixed (immutable): the image and properties will not change.

The voucher’s face value does not depend on the price at which the NFT was purchased — before or after presale.\n\nThe voucher is activated automatically after TGE and is valid for 12 months and only on the Lumiros platform. The discount applies to the price at the time of purchase; it may be used in parts or in a single transaction. The remaining balance and history are shown in your account.\n\nThe voucher is non-transferable and is voided upon sale of the NFT. It cannot be transferred, gifted, or sold separately from the NFT.\n\nThe voucher has no cash value and is not redeemable for cash or cryptocurrency. It grants only the right to buy VIGRI tokens at a discount within the Lumiros platform.",

Duplicates are impossible — every card has its own mint address and number.\n\nThe serial number does not affect the card’s rights or token amount; it exists for transparency, authenticity verification, and to support the collection’s value.",
  "nft.explain.bronze.d7": "Bronze holders gain early access to selected sections and services of the Lumiros ecosystem. This includes the opportunity to test new features first, participate in closed trials, and receive news about releases before public announcements.\n\nAccess activates automatically after TGE and is confirmed by holding a Bronze NFT in your wallet. Some activities may require wallet connection or additional verification within your account.\n\nThe list of available services will expand as the platform evolves. The early access right remains valid as long as the NFT is in your possession.",

  "nft.explain.silver_buy.text": "An NFT is a unique digital card on the Solana network that is stored in your wallet (e.g., Phantom). By purchasing Silver, you secure the card and the right to receive 1,250,000 VIGRI.\n\nThe card belongs to you: you may hold it, gift it, or sell it on marketplaces; it will appear in “My NFTs” in your account, and the related rights will be available there as well. Payment is made via the connected wallet: choose the quantity and confirm the transaction; the network fee is charged in SOL.\n\nFor Silver you must complete KYC in accordance with the platform rules and amount thresholds.
